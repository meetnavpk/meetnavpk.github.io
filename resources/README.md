1- As mentioned earlier, book needs to take reader from beginner level to advanced level. Chapters need to be grouped into three categories(Beginner, Intermediate and advanced). Such grouping introduction can be provided at the start of book as "Preface".

2- Need to provide details in beginning of book for how this book is different from others on same topic(Data and AI)

3- Would be good to relate data and AI concepts with daily life examples of how human brain do the same things that data and AI systems are doing today using computations. May be there could be one section with title "We all are data scientists". Keep the reader's journey through out book in light of information provided in this section by relating human brain predictive analytic process with ML algos.

4- Classify the ML algorithms based on problem classifications. Please don't confuse this classification with machine learning classification problem :-). 

5- Reader's journey through book should give him/her confidence to become data scientist. He/She (irrespective of what is reader's background) should not get feeling of that this book is only for highly qualified people.

6- Comment in point 5 above needs thorough and deep thought process. Summary Using speech bubbles stories with diagrams in the beginning/end of each chapter would really be a nice idea.

7- Add legends like "Tips, Warning, Concepts to Master if someone wants to deep dive further etc.
